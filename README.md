# The NIST Statistical Test Suite

This repository contains the code for testing random number generators published by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). The code was created to accompany NIST SP-800-22 R1a, a copy of which can be found in this repository.

Given that this is rather useful code, and that it was unavailble in January 2019 due to the US government shutdown, I thought it would be useful to publish this for reference. (Call to action for civic hackers: we need a curated site that links to this kind of material.)

## Import structure

So that we can add the usual gitlab sugar and keep clear "what is new here" vs "what came from NIST", the NIST code is in the subdirectory `sts`.
